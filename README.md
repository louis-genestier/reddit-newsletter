# Reddit Newsletter  

An easy way to get a daily newsletter of the top posts from your favorite subreddits.

## Getting Started

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
You can copy the content from `.env.example` and fill the values.  
For subreddits, you have to separate them with a comma.  
By default it'll run every day at 20h.
